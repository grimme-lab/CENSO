    Commandline Energetic Sorting (CENSO) is a sorting algorithm for efficient
    evaluation of Structure Ensembles (SE). The input ensemble (or single structure)
    originating from a CREST[SQM/FF] run can be ranked by free energy at DFT level
    and structures can be optimized at DFT level. CENSO has a modular structure, 
    enabling efficient sorting at different levels of theory and targeting individual 
    error sources, e.g., energy or solvation. Sorting is based on (free) energy windows
    or thresholds, within which all conformers/structures are considered. By choosing
    appropriate thresholds, the following "properties" can be obtained:

    * lowest lying conformer and corresponding free energy
    * fully optimized SE and averaged ensemble free energy
    * Boltzmann populated SE at a given temperature

    Apart from the refinement/sorting of SE, CENSO offers an automated approach to 
    calculate NMR properties (shielding and coupling constants) or optical rotatory 
    (OR) dispersion.

    To perform fast calculations CENSO interfaces with QM codes like xTB, TURBOMOLE 
    and ORCA. The results are read by CENSO and evaluated in the sorting algorithm.

    CENSO is structured into several parts, which can all be turned on or off by the 
    user. These parts are presented in their intended order: 

    1) Part0: Cheap prescreening
    2) Part1: Prescreening
    3) part2: Optimization (and free energy calculation)
    4) part3: Refinement   (optional at higher hybrid-DFA level)
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    The following parts are "property" parts for NMR or OR and not necessary if only 
    a SE refinement is needed.
    5) part4: NMR-Mode
    6) part5: OR-Mode


    Nomenclature: Free energies are not available in each sorting step, due to the 
    computational cost involved. Sorting-thresholds based on incomplete free energies
    e.g., without thermostatistical contribution (G_mRRRHO) are denoted by lower case
    g_thr and full free energies by upper case G_thr.

    Parts 0-3 are concerned with efficient SE sorting, optimization and calculation
    of Boltzmann weigths for populated structures. The parts are described in the 
    following:

    Part0 - Cheap prescreening:

    Flexible and/or large molecules can have many conformers (i.e., several hundred)
    and sorting out truly high lying conformers fast is crucial for efficiency. 
    This is the goal of part0. Here the electronic energy description is improved upon
    the initial SQM/FF energy by performing very fast B97-D3(0)/def2-SV(P)+gcp 
    single-point calculations. If the molecule is in solution phase, solvation is treated
    at GFN2-xTB[ALPB] level. Sorting is based on g_thr(0) which has to be rather large, 
    e.g. 4 kcal/mol or above. 

    Part1 - Prescreening:

    Accurate electronic and solvation energies are calculated in part1. To be efficient
    COSMO-RS solvation contributions are calculated at r2SCAN-3c level, whereby
    both the gas phase electronic energy and solvation contribution is obtained and 
    no additional calculations are necessary. Conformers above the threshold g_thr(1)
    are discarded. After sorting, thermostatistical contributions (G_mRRHO) are 
    calculated at GFN2-xTB[ALPB] level using single-point hessian (SPH) calculations. 
    Full free energies are calculated and sorting is performed based on G_thr(1). 
    The threshold can be automatically increased (fuzzy-threshold) as a function of
    the standard deviation of G_mRRHO, which is the case for flexible or diverse SE.
    Up to now all calculations have been performed on the SQM/FF input geometries!


    Part2 - Optimiation:

    The relevant conformers/structures have to be optimized at DFT (r2SCAN-3c) level 
    in implicit solvation (DCOSMO-RS). An efficient ensemble optimizer has been 
    implemented, where all conformers are optimized for 8 iterations. Then a spearman 
    correlation coefficient is calculated to check for parallel potential energy surfaces.
    If parallellity can be assumed, the sorting threshold G_thr(2) is decreased
    and conformers above the threshold are discarded, if their gradient norm is below
    a predefined threshold. For large ensembles, this decreases the number of high 
    lying conformers fast. The batch wise optimization is repeated until all confomers 
    within the energy window G_thr(2) are fully optimized. On the DFT optimized geometries
    free energies are calculated like in part1, with COSMO-RS(r2SCAN-3c) for E and
    dG_solv and GFN2-xTB[ALPB]-SPH for G_mRRHO. Boltzmann weights are calculated and
    an ensemble averaged free energy can be obtained. The conformers for use in 
    parts 3-5 are considered up to a Boltzmann sum threshold, e.g., all conformers 
    up to 90 % population are further considered.


    Part3 - Refinement:

    If it is necessary to refine the calculated Boltzmann weights at a higher (hybrid)
    DFT level, this can be performed in part3. Also it has to be noted, that Boltzmann
    weights calculated from rather accurate r2SCAN-3c energies are reliable enough 
    for most applications. Like in part2 free energy contributions are calculated 
    on DFT optimized geometries, although using a higher (hybrid) DFT level. Conformers
    below a Boltzmann sum threshold are considered further (e.g. in part4 or part5).


    Optional property related parts (part4 and part5) are described below:

    Part4 - NMR-Mode:
    
    In part4 NMR properties can be calculated for the populated conformers. The 
    Boltzmann weights are taken from either part1, part2 or part3 if they are available.
    All populated conformers up to the population part2_threshold or part3_threshold
    are considered. Coupling and shielding constants are calculated separately 
    and can be calculated for the elements H, C, F, Si, P, or all elements.
    Files for further processing with ANMR are created.
    After the CENSO run, NMR spectra can be calculated using the ANMR code.

    Part5 - OR-Mode:

    In part5 optical rotatory (OR) dispersion of the populated structure ensemble
    can be calculated. Boltzmann weights can be taken from part1, part2 or part3.

    Set up CENSO:

    When running CENSO for the first time you are asked to creat a global 
    configuration file .censorc. This file contains all settings CENSO operates 
    with and you should adjust the settings to your needs. In the first part of 
    the .censorc the paths of the employed programs have to be provided. The .censorc
    can be read by CENSO, if the file is located in your home folder e.g. ~/.censorc
    or it is located in your current working directory. The current directory is 
    always preferred to the global censorc in your home directory.

    restarting calculations.

    The file coord.enso_best contains the geometry of the lowest lying conformer
    determined by the sorting procedure. The sorted ensemble geometries are written to
    the files enso_ensemble_part*.xyz.

    The file coord.enso_best is (over-) written in parts 0-3 and contains the geometry of
    the conformer with the lowest free energy. 

    The files enso_ensemble_part1.xyz and enso_ensemble_part2.xyz contain the sorted 
    ensembles after part1 or part2. The files enso_ensemble_part2_p_XX.xyz contain
    the sorted ensemble up to a Boltzmann population of XX %.

    The files partX.dat are just for convenience and contain the same printout

    thresholds = f"""
    CENSO is a threshold based sorting algorithm. The thresholds have been determined
    for typical drug-like organic molecules up to 100 atoms.

    For cases with high flexibility or very different conformer ordering between SQM/FF and
    DFT it can be necessary to increase the thresholds.

    If your target quantity is an averaged ensemble free energy, be sure not to 
    use small energy windows in part0 and part1, as this can falsely reduce the 
    ensemble size.

    In the following the employed thresholds are listed and their use is explained:

    Part0 - Cheap Prescreening:
            
            part0_threshold = g_thr(0)
            cml:      -part0_threshold
            censorc:  part0_threshold

            part0_threshold g_thr(0) is an energy window /threshold in kcal/mol 
            within which all conformers are considered. The CENSO internal default 
            for g_thr(0) = {default_settings.internal_defaults.get("part0_threshold",{})["default"]} kcal/mol. The sorting threshold is designed to 
            remove conformers very high lying in electronic energy (E).


    Part1 - Prescreening:

            In part1 two sorting steps are applied. One based on g_thr(1) with 
            improved energy and solvation description and one on G_thr(1) where 
            thermostatistical contributions have been calculated additionally. 
            

            part1_threshold = g_thr(1) and G_thr(1)
            cml:      -part1_threshold 
            censorc:  part1_threshold

            part1_threshold g_thr(1) is an energy window /threshold in kcal/mol 
            within which all conformers are considered. The CENSO internal default 
            for g_thr(1) = {default_settings.internal_defaults.get("part1_threshold",{})["default"]} kcal/mol. The sorting threshold g_thr(1) is designed to 
            remove high lying conformers based on improved electronic energy (E)
            and solvation contributions (dG_solv). G_thr(1) sorting is based on
            full free energy including thermostatistical contributions (G_mRRHO).
            Both, g_thr(1) and G_thr(1) use the same base threshold e.g. 3.5 kcal/mol
            and G_thr(1) can be automatically increased as a function of the standard
            deviation of G_mRRHO in the structure ensemble, indicating high structural
            diversity and possibly larger errors (fuzzy sorting).


    Part2 - Optimization:

            In part2 two sorting thresholds are applied. One which is applied during
            geometry optimization and one Boltzmann sum threshold.

            threshold applied during optimization G_thr(opt,2):
            cml:      -opt_limit
            censorc:  opt_limit

            Spearman-threshold for testing for parallel PES:
            cml:      -spearmanthr
            censorc:  spearmanthr

            Boltzmann sum threshold G_thr(2):
            cml:      -thrpart2
            censorc:  part2_threshold

            The internal default for G_thr(opt,2) is set to {default_settings.internal_defaults.get("opt_limit",{})["default"]} kcal/mol. During 
            the geometry optimization the initial threshold G_thr(opt,2) is
            increased by 60 % (or at least 1.5 kcal/mol). If the PES can be assumed
            parallel (tested by a spearman rank coefficient) the threshold is 
            decresed until it reaches the initial value. All conformers with (free)
            energies above the G_thr(opt,2) threshold are discarded and all conformers
            below G_thr(opt,2) will by fully DFT optimized. The last threshold
            employed in part2 G_thr(2) is a Boltzmann sum threshold and all populated
            conformers of the ensemble, up to the Boltzmann population (in %)
            are considered further. 

    Part3 - Refinement:

            In part3 a Boltzmann sum threshold is employed.
            
            Boltzmann sum threshold G_thr(3):
            cml:      -thrpart2
            censorc:  part2_threshold
            
            Based on high level free energies Boltzmann weights are calculated 
            and all conformers up to the Boltzmann sum threshold (in %) are 
            considered further.

    Part4 - NMR properties:

            In part4 only Boltzmann sum thresholds of part2 G_thr(2) or part3 G_thr(3) 
            are applied. It is possible to calculate part4 using Boltzmann weights
            from part1, but since there is no Boltzmann sum threshold in part1, in this 
            case, the threshold G_thr(2) is used. The NMR properties are calculated 
            on populated conformers up to the Boltzmann threshold in %. 

    Part5 - Optical rotatory dispersion:

            In part4 only Boltzmann sum thresholds of part2 G_thr(2) or part3 G_thr(3) 
            are applied. It is possible to calculate part5 using Boltzmann weights
            from part1, but since there is no Boltzmann sum threshold in part1, in this 
            case, the threshold G_thr(2) is used. The OR property is calculated 
            on populated conformers up to the Boltzmann threshold in %. For optical
            rotation it is necessary to include almost the entire ensemble e.g. 99 %

    solvation = """
    CENSO uses several QM-packages and not all solvents are available for all 
    solvation models throughout the QM-packages.
    For this reason a user editable file is created in the folder:

        $  ~/.censo_assets/censo_solvents.json

    which contains a dictionary of all available solvent models and solvents.
    If a solvent is not available with a certain solvent model, the user can then
    choose a replacement solvent. E.g. if benzene is not available choose toluene. 

    Example for the solvent name in CENSO, the solvent models (xtb represents ALPB or GBSA).
    The list [None, "toluene"] means that the solvent is not found in the solvent
    model and that the solvent toluene in the same solvent model is used instead.
    DC = Dieclectric constant (used in COSMO).

    "acetone": {
        "cosmors": ["propanone_c0", "propanone_c0"], 
        "dcosmors": ["propanone", "propanone"],
        "xtb": ["acetone", "acetone"],
        "cpcm": ["acetone", "acetone"],
        "smd": ["ACETONE", "ACETONE"],

        "DC": 2.3,
    },

    The solvent file is directly used in `CENSO` and typos will cause the 
    calculations to crash! Adding a new solvent is as easy as adding a new 
    dictionary entry to the file.


    In CENSO several solvent models can be applied. The intent is either a good 
    description of the free energy (keyword: smgsolv*) or an implicit effect on
    a property or geometry (keyword: sm*).
